Literally the most powerful minecraft cheat ever made, in a light and public release.

Updated with mods we think would be good for public use.

### Maintaining

TheAlphaEpsilon, OverFloyd , fraazolini and Fleyr have contribuited on the dev repo and will help keep this updated

## Installing

1. Get Minecraft
7. Install this as a Forge Mod
420. profit

## Wiki

If you need any help, please check the [ForgeHax Wiki](https://github.com/fr1kin/ForgeHax/wiki) before submitting an issue.
No really, fr1kin's wiki is well kept and covers some basic and generic shit. I won't make a wiki as cool as that one for this fork.

## Capes

We have extra textures! Upload [HERE](http://upload.2b2t.it)

## External Connections (Read this if you don't want to leak your IP)

This mod will get data from:
* Minecraft's API (api.mojang.com, sessionserver.mojang.com)
* 2b2tatlas.com
* data.2b2t.it
* irc.2b2t.it

This is relatively safe, as it is essentially just going to these websites on a browser.

This mod will send data to:
* irc.2b2t.it

Only if you connect to an IRC server. Please note: due to how IRC works, your IP info will be send to ALL other members in the IRC chat.
Use at your own risk.

As always, use of a VPN can hide your IP address from others.

## Known Issues

Most recent Optifine release breaks Markers. All Optifine releases break XRay. (Also XRay isn't really XRay but install Wurst ffs)

## Building

The usual shit. `gradlew setupDecompWorkspace`, `gradlew build`.

## Why are you making this public

Because I can. I used to have quite exclusive haccs but now everyone seems to have them. I want to share the way I did things.
