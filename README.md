Literally the most powerful minecraft cheat ever made, in a light and public release.

This is kinda scuffed, I lazily merge stuff from my dev branch into here, but I kinda stopped doing it for a while. If enough people care, I may start merging polish and features again.

## Installing

1. Get Minecraft
7. Install this as a Forge Mod
420. profit

## Wiki

If you need any help, please check the [ForgeHax Wiki](https://github.com/fr1kin/ForgeHax/wiki) before submitting an issue.
No really, fr1kin's wiki is well kept and covers some basic and generic shit. I won't make a wiki as cool as that one for this fork.

## Known Issues

Most recent Optifine release breaks Markers. All Optifine releases break XRay. (Also XRay isn't really XRay but install Wurst ffs)

## Building

The usual shit. `gradlew setupDecompWorkspace`, `gradlew build`.

## Why are you making this public

Because I can. I used to have quite exclusive haccs but now everyone seems to have them. I want to share the way I did things.
