Literally the most powerful minecraft cheat ever made, in a light and public release.

Updated with mods we think would be good for public use.

In case you cannot read, this is a fork of fr1kin's ForgeHax. Since the 1.12.2 branch is not actively developed, we added more stuff in ourselves.

### Maintaining

TheAlphaEpsilon, OverFloyd, FraazT0 and Fleyr have contribuited on the dev repo and will help keep this updated.

### Discord support
You can join a very Work-In-Progress discord server [HERE](https://discord.gg/8QjDRRPyeh). No guarantee is made about server being _not dead_.

## Installing

1. Get Minecraft
7. Install this as a Forge Mod
420. profit

## Wiki

If you need any help, please check the [ForgeHax Wiki](https://github.com/fr1kin/ForgeHax/wiki) before submitting an issue.
No really, fr1kin's wiki is well kept and covers some basic and generic shit. I won't make a wiki as cool as that one for this fork.

## Capes

We have extra textures! Upload [HERE](http://upload.2b2t.it)

## External Connections (Read this if you don't want to leak your IP)

This mod will get data from:
* Minecraft's API (api.mojang.com, sessionserver.mojang.com)
* 2b2tatlas.com
* data.2b2t.it
* irc.2b2t.it (only if using IRC)

This is relatively safe, as it is essentially just going to these websites on a browser. **Any connection to any service will make its source known to the receiving server**.

This mod will send data to:
* irc.2b2t.it (only if using IRC)

Please note: IRC identifies users by IP. If the server you're connecting to does not enforce IP masks, your IP will be shared will any user requesting it. `irc.2b2t.it` does mask your IP, and so does `irc.freenode.net`. Private servers might not do so, **investigate server policies before connecting to unknown IRC hosts**.

As always, use of a VPN can hide your IP address from others.

### IRC

By default, the IRC service won't connect to anything. If you wish to use IRC chat, turn on `.irc auto-connect`. It is set to connect to `irc.2b2t.it` by default and join the `#fhchat` public channel, but neither is enforced.

## Known Issues

Most recent Optifine release breaks Markers. All Optifine releases break XRay. (Also XRay isn't really XRay but install Wurst ffs)

## Building

The usual shit. `gradlew setupDecompWorkspace`, `gradlew build`.

## Why are you making this public

Because I can. I used to have quite exclusive haccs but now everyone seems to have them. I want to share the way I did things.
